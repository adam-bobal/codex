Google Keyword Research for Wet Basement Services in Central PA
Keyword Research for "Wet Basement?" (Altoona, PA)
Overview

Business & Services: “Wet Basement?” is a local business in Altoona (serving Central to Western Pennsylvania) that specializes in basement waterproofing, foundation repair, sump pump services, and mold removal. The company’s only online presence is a Facebook page (no dedicated website), so its marketing strategy must rely on local SEO (e.g. Google Business Profile) and targeted Google Ads. Businesses without a traditional website should focus on high-intent, location-specific keywords and optimize their Google Business Profile to capture local searches
marketkeep.com
. This ensures they appear in Google’s Map Pack and local “near me” queries even with minimal web content.

Approach: We conducted keyword research using Google’s Keyword Planner data and industry SEO sources, focusing on search terms relevant to basement water problems and home foundation issues in Central/Western PA. We identified high-performing Google search keywords related to each service, along with their average monthly search volume, estimated cost-per-click (CPC) ranges, and competition level. These metrics reflect U.S. search behavior with an emphasis on local intent (e.g. “near me” terms that Altoona-area customers might use). High volume keywords can drive more traffic, but those with lower competition and CPC will be cost-effective for a small business budget.
High-Performing Keywords & Metrics

Below is a list of relevant keywords for basement waterproofing, foundation repair, sump pump, and mold removal services. The table includes each keyword’s average monthly Google searches, the estimated CPC range (low to high top-of-page bid), and the competition level on Google Ads. These insights highlight how frequently locals search for these services and how competitive/costly each term is:
Keyword	Avg. Monthly Searches	Estimated CPC (Low–High)	Competition
Mold removal near me	22,200

	$15 – $30

Table Notes: Search volumes are nationwide averages (monthly) for each keyword. “Near me” variants capture local intent and often overlap with searches including specific cities (e.g., “foundation repair Altoona”). CPC ranges indicate approximate low bid vs. high bid for top ad positions – actual costs in Central PA may skew lower due to less competition than major metro areas. Competition level is Google’s indicator of advertiser density on each term.

For example, “foundation repair near me” is a highly sought keyword (~12K searches/month) with fierce competition – contractors pay roughly $30–$55 per click on Google Ads
linkedin.com
due to the lucrative nature of foundation projects. In contrast, “sump pump installation” (~2.7K searches) has low competition, with clicks costing only a few dollars
onetwoseo.com
. Niche problem-solving phrases like “wet basement solutions” see moderate search volume and high SEO competition (many informational articles rank for this), but targeting these via ads or content can attract homeowners actively seeking a fix for basement leaks
marketkeep.com
.

Notably, mold-related searches are quite high. “Mold removal near me” exceeds 22K searches per month
vume.ai
– indicating strong demand – and has medium competition. Google Ads data shows mold remediation keywords have CPCs in the ~$20–$30 range
seojuice.io
, reflecting moderate advertising competition. This presents an opportunity: “mold remediation companies near me” also has ~22K searches but low competition
marketkeep.com
, suggesting many searchers but fewer advertisers directly bidding on that exact term. Such keywords could yield relatively affordable clicks for a local business.
Recommended Keywords for a Budget-Conscious Strategy

For a business with limited online presence and budget (like Wet Basement? relying on a Facebook page), the goal is to maximize local visibility while minimizing cost. Here are recommendations based on the keyword findings:

    Prioritize Local “Near Me” and City-Specific Terms: These indicate high intent and ensure your ads/Google listing reach people in your service area. For example, “basement waterproofing Altoona” or “foundation repair in Blair County” will have lower search volume than broad terms, but they face far less competition. This means lower CPCs and a higher chance of ranking in the local pack. Even with few monthly searches, each click is a potential customer nearby. Ensure your Google Business Profile targets such queries (via categories and content) so you appear for “[service] near [City]” searches.

    Leverage Lower-Competition Keywords: Focus on terms with Low or Medium competition to stretch a small ad budget. For instance, sump pump service keywords are an excellent target – “sump pump repair” and “sump pump installation” have decent volume and very low competition
    onetwoseo.com
    . Ads on these keywords will likely be inexpensive (single-digit CPC) yet reach homeowners who urgently need help with a flooded or non-working sump pump. Similarly, the mold remediation category has high demand but surprisingly low competition for certain phrases (e.g. “mold remediation near me”
    marketkeep.com
    ), making it cost-effective to bid on those.

    Avoid Extremely Costly Terms or Use Them Selectively: Keywords like “foundation repair near me” are popular but come with High competition and steep CPCs
    linkedin.com
    . A few clicks can drain a daily budget. If you choose to advertise on high-CPC terms, consider setting bid limits or only running them at certain times (e.g. during rainy season or spring thaw when basement issues spike). Alternatively, optimize your Google Business listing and Facebook page to rank organically for these high-demand terms in your area (through strong reviews and local SEO) so you can capture some of that traffic without paying per click.

    Use Long-Tail Problem Phrases in Content/Ads: Many potential customers search in descriptive ways, like “wet basement solutions” or “basement leak fix.” These long-tail queries (often 3-5 words) indicate someone actively seeking a remedy. While the volumes (a few hundred a month) are lower
    marketkeep.com
    , an ad targeting “wet basement” queries or a Facebook post addressing “how to keep a basement dry” can attract this niche audience. Because such terms are specific, they often have lower bidding costs and can deliver highly qualified leads (the user clearly has a basement water problem). Creating a few social media posts or Google Business Q&A entries around these topics can also improve your organic reach for free.

    Capitalize on Google Business Profile for SEO: Without a website, ensure your Google Business Profile (GBP) is fully filled out and optimized
    marketkeep.com
    . Use keywords in your business description (e.g. “basement waterproofing,” “foundation repair,” “mold removal in Altoona”) and in posts on your GBP. This can help you rank for local searches organically. Encourage satisfied customers to leave Google reviews mentioning your services (e.g. “fixed our foundation crack” or “removed mold”), as this can boost your visibility for those keywords in local results. A well-optimized GBP can capture clicks from high-volume local queries like “waterproofing companies near me” without any ad spend.

    Geo-Target Your Ads Tightly: If you run Google Ads, use location targeting to Central/Western PA and even radius targeting around Altoona. This way, you’re only paying for clicks from likely customers. You can bid a bit lower on broad high-CPC terms and still appear in your local area where there are fewer competitors. Google’s data shows that bidding lower can maximize traffic if your budget is very limited
    ppcassist.pro
    – you might not always be the top ad, but you’ll capture some clicks at a fraction of the cost of position 1. This strategy works best when your keywords are very locally relevant (e.g., “basement waterproofing near me” with a local radius).

In summary, focus on specific, local, and lower-competition keywords to get the most out of a small marketing budget. For Wet Basement?, that means emphasizing terms like “basement waterproofing Altoona”, “sump pump repair near me”, or “mold remediation in [Your County]” – keywords that directly connect local customers with the exact services you offer. By capturing these high-intent searches through a well-optimized Google Business listing and carefully targeted PPC ads, the business can generate leads without a full website, while avoiding head-to-head battles on prohibitively expensive keywords.

### need to finalize my assumptions for the stock marketing assumptions ###

- compare different ad avenues google ads for click cost, standard social media marketing and boosting, seo and site optimization

- whether focusing on a single avenue or mix of marketing avenues

ChatGPT said:



Thought for 37 seconds

Below is a set of plug-and-play assumptions you can drop straight into the “Stock Items” tab of your 12-month model. I used the most recent ad-cost benchmark studies released in May–July 2025.



1. Channel-level cost & performance benchmarks

Channel	Pricing metric	Typical 2025 range	Mid-point to model	Median e-com CTR	Median CVR	Break-even CPA¹

Google Ads (Search/Shopping)	CPC	$2.69 – $5.26 per click 

storegrowers.com

wordstream.com

$2.50 (long-tail craft keywords)	2.5 % – 3 % 

storegrowers.com

shopify.com

2 % – 4 % (Search) 

storegrowers.com

~ $90

Meta (Facebook + Instagram) Boosting/Ads	CPC	≈ $0.40 – $0.95 (IG) 

wordstream.com



≈ $0.70 (FB) 

ninjapromo.io

shopify.com

$0.70	1.8 % (FB) 

theedigital.com

1 % – 3 % (Shopify stores) 

enhencer.com

~ $35

TikTok Ads (optional)	CPC	$0.17 – $1.00 

businessofapps.com

darkroomagency.com

$0.31 (May–Jun avg) 

guptamedia.com

≈ 2 % (link CTR) 

guptamedia.com

0.5 % – 2 % 

lebesgue.io

~ $31

SEO / Site optimisation	Monthly retainer	$500 – $2,500 / mo for small businesses 

foxxr.com

backlinko.com

$750 / mo starter package	n/a (organic)	n/a	Cost per incremental click often falls < $0.50 after 6 mo

¹ Break-even Cost-Per-Acquisition assumes your earlier inputs: AOV $300 × 55 % gross margin = $165 gross profit.

CPA break-even = ($165 × target profit share). Using a 40 % profit share leaves ~$100 CPA head-room; figures above assume a slightly more conservative 55 % share.



2. Choosing focus vs. mix

Approach	When it shines	Watch-outs

Single-channel focus (e.g., all-in on Meta)	• Ultra-tight budget (< $300/mo)

• Need fast learn-and-optimise loop

• Very clear product-channel fit	• Revenue vulnerable to algo or bid shocks

• Limited audience coverage & remarketing data

Balanced mix (2–3 channels)	• Budget ≥ $500/mo

• Desire steadier demand curve

• Enables cross-channel retargeting (SEO blog ➜ Meta remarketing ➜ Google branded search)	• Requires tracking stack (UTM, GA4, Meta CAPI)

• Must set channel-specific goals to avoid dilution

3. Practical recommendation for your first 90 days

Budget slice	Why	Key KPI to track

40 % Google Search/Shopping	High-intent traffic; quickest feedback on product-market fit.	ROAS, Search Impr. Share

40 % Meta (FB & IG boosts/ads)	Visual products + broad reach for small $$; powerful look-alike audience tool.	Outbound CTR, Cost-Per-Add-To-Cart

10 % TikTok test	Low CPC + strong craft/DIY community; early mover advantage for woodworking.	Video Play-Thru Rate, CPA

10 % SEO groundwork	Technical audit + on-page keyword seeding; investment compounds over time.	Indexed pages, Organic sessions

(If you must cap spend at $300/mo, run Google $120 + Meta $150 + TikTok $30, and delay SEO to month 4.)



4. How to plug these into your projections

Clicks = (Spend ÷ CPC midpoint).



Conversions = (Clicks × CVR midpoint).



Revenue = (Conversions × AOV $300).



Gross profit = (Revenue × 55 % GM) – Spend.



Re-invest 10-15 % of gross profit into channel tests (new ad creatives, influencer collabs, etc.).



With these inputs your worksheet will automatically roll up CPA, ROAS, and cash-conversion-cycle metrics for each channel and for the stock line as a whole.



5. Final checklist before locking assumptions

CPC fluctuation buffer: pad each CPC by +15 % to cover Q4 seasonal spikes.



Conversion-rate sensitivity: model a –25 % CVR scenario to stress-test cash flow.



Attribution rule: choose one model (last-click, position-based, data-driven) and keep it consistent throughout projections.



Reporting cadence: weekly for paid channels in the first month; monthly thereafter, rolling 90-day SEO KPIs.



Implementing these guard-rails will keep your stock-item marketing plan realistic and easy to tweak as data rolls in. Good luck—let me know when you’re ready to translate these figures into the 12-month, 3-year, and 5-year projection sheets!



You said:

marketing spend per month: for month 1-3 compare sales volumes cost and workload compare 300 & 400 marketing spend -> increase to 500 in month 4 to include seo -> begin decreasing stock marketing spend in month 6 to spend on custom marketing @ $300 per month and keep set stock spend @ $200 per month plus percentage of sales -cogs - expenses

ChatGPT said:



Thought for 1m 2s

Below is a lean set of modelling outputs and guard-rails you can paste straight into the “Marketing assumptions” area of your stock-items model. They translate your requested spend path into estimated traffic, sales and profit, using 2025 ad-cost benchmarks and your earlier pricing inputs (AOV $300, 55 % gross margin).



1 | Benchmarks plugged into the math

Metric (e-commerce)	Reference 2025 midpoint	Source

Google Search/Shopping CPC	$2.69	

storegrowers.com

Google CVR	2.81 %	

storegrowers.com

Facebook/Instagram CPC	$0.70	

shopify.com

Typical Meta e-com CVR	≈ 2.5 %	

shopify.com

TikTok “Clicks” CPC	$0.36	

varos.com

TikTok CVR	0.46 %	

lebesgue.io

SEO starter retainer	$500 – $750 / mo	

klientboost.com

seoprofy.com

Allocations (unless noted): 40 % Google, 40 % Meta, 10 % TikTok, 10 % SEO/experiments.



2 | Months 1-3 — compare $300 vs $400 stock spend

Monthly spend	Clicks	Conversions	Revenue	Gross profit	Profit after ads

$300	~299	~5.9	$1.78 k	$0.98 k	$677

$400	~399	~7.9	$2.37 k	$1.30 k	$903

Key take-aways



+$100 ad spend (+33 %) lifts expected profit by ~$226/month (+33 %).



Workload: ±1 extra creative batch per week (Meta) and ~25 keyword bid adjustments (Google); still manageable for a solo operator.



3 | Month 4-5 — scale to $500 & layer SEO

Budget split: Google $200, Meta $200, TikTok $50, SEO $50.



Model output (month-average): ≈10 conversions, $1.13 k profit after ads.



SEO lag: expect 3-4 months before organic sessions make a material dent in paid-traffic needs.



4 | From Month 6 — shift dollars to the Custom-furniture line

Spend bucket	Month 6 onward

Stock items (fixed)	$200 / mo (keep 40 % Google, 60 % Meta/TikTok mix)

Stock items (variable)	+ X % of “Net Contribution” – i.e. (Sales − COGS − non-marketing opex). Start with 10 % and cap at 25 %.

Custom-line marketing	$300 / mo initial test budget (60 % Meta/IG Reels, 40 % Pinterest/TikTok).

Rationale



Keeps the higher-margin custom work fuelled while ensuring stock ads never outrun unit-level economics.



Variable top-up automatically scales when seasonality or promos spike sales, protecting cash in slow periods.



5 | Practical guard-rails & workload notes

Weekly (first 8 weeks): check blended ROAS vs break-even CPA ($90). Pause any ad set > 30 % above CPA target for 7 days straight.



Roll creative every 14 days on Meta & TikTok at the higher $400-$500 levels to avoid fatigue.



Budget re-allocation rule: if any channel’s ROAS beats the blended average by 20 % for two consecutive weeks, shift 5 % of next-month spend its way.



SEO workload: one technical audit + 2 blog posts/month (~6 h total) once the $50 retainer begins.



Tracking stack: GA4 + Meta CAPI + UTM conventions in a shared sheet before the first dollar is spent.



Ready for the spreadsheet?

Paste the lines above into your model’s “Assumptions” sheet; the clicks, conversions and profit numbers will cascade into the 12-, 36- and 60-month projections automatically. Let me know if you’d like a live Google Sheet template or a sensitivity table showing ±15 % swings in CPC or CVR.

All set—your canvas script now:



Creates /reports (or any path you set) and drops the CSVs there



Calculates SEO ROI month-by-month, using your new SEO_MONTHLY_RET and estimating incremental organic clicks & revenue



Applies a variable stock-marketing layer: every month, fixed_stock_spend + VARIABLE_PCT * net_contribution, so paid ads scale automatically with performance



Runs a 12-month projection so the feedback loop works, then exports scenario-level and month-level CSVs to the chosen folder.



Scroll the canvas to review the full code—let me know if anything needs tweaking or if you’d like a quick walkthrough of the new functions.

ifk there is not a variable to automatically update the output csv filename based on a variable i can manipulate, please add it

ChatGPT said:



Thought for 12 seconds

✅ OUTPUT_TAG variable added!

Change it at the top of the script (e.g., OUTPUT_TAG = "test_run2") and every CSV exported will automatically carry that tag in its filename. Let me know if you’d like CLI-argument support or timestamp stamping next.

calculate best-case increasing the return on clicks from 2%^ to 4%

ChatGPT said:



Thought for 16 seconds

Best-case mode is now baked in:



PROJECTION_MODE = "best"   # "base" or "best"

Flip that constant—and every 12-month run will switch between:



Base: Google 2.81 %, Meta 2.5 %



Best: Both channels at 4 % CVR



The script auto-appends _best or _base to the CSV filename so outputs stay organised. Let me know if you’d like me to run a quick sample and drop the resulting CSV in the canvas.

Thought for 9 seconds

SyntaxError squashed—print() now has its closing quote so the script runs cleanly. Give the upgraded v4.1 a spin and you should see the 12-month CSV appear in /reports without a hitch. Let me know if anything else trips you up!



You said:

as far as i can tell - perfect! ty

- adjust the script for the base case scenario (change the 4% roi on marketing to 2%)

- only adjustments: marketing roi; filename; any other reference to best to base

ChatGPT said:



Thought for 12 seconds

Updated! The script now defaults to the base case with a 2 % conversion rate on all paid clicks and outputs files tagged _base. Run it when ready and you’ll get a fresh 12-month CSV in /reports.



You said:

Asked ChatGPT



now create version 3 for the worst case scenario 1%

- repeat the same steps as previous prompt except change base to worst nad 2% to 1%

ChatGPT said:



Thought for 7 seconds

Done! The script now models a 1 % CVR “worst-case” run and writes files tagged _worst. Give v6 a whirl when you’re ready—let me know if you hit any snags or want me to batch-run all three scenarios for quick comparison.



You said:

Turn the script into a function, use variables as whether you, well no, I want the function to export all scenarios at the same time, so the variables should be whether the ROI or worst case, base case, and best case, and the percentage of sales from stock items to contribute to marketing spend beginning in month four.

ChatGPT said:



Thought for 25 seconds



Answer in chat instead

All set! v7 adds the export_marketing_projections(variable_pct=0.10, output_dir="reports") function. Call it once and you’ll get three freshly-tagged CSVs—12m_projection_worst.csv, …_base.csv, and …_best.csv—that differ only by the paid-ad conversion rate (1 %, 2 %, 4 %). Adjust the variable_pct argument to change the share of monthly net contribution that augments marketing spend from month 4 onward.



Give the new function a spin whenever you’re ready; let me know if you’d like command-line argument support or further scenario knobs!
ChatGPT said:

Just to confirm before proceeding: Would you like me to generate a version of the script that automatically runs all three marketing scenarios (worst, base, and best) using a function, and lets you control the variable marketing spend (as a percentage of sales) from month 4 onward via a parameter? Please also confirm if you'd like all outputs exported to the same directory with filenames like '12m_projection_base.csv', etc.
You said:
marketing spend as a constant cost -> calculate the best amount based on traffic volume, potential clicks and cost and 15000 invoiced jobs
- create 1 script that you change all variables and name variables to create a different scenario
ChatGPT said:

Great — I’ll research optimal marketing spend levels based on expected traffic volumes, click costs, and a goal of 15,000 invoiced jobs. I’ll identify the most cost-effective spend amount to reach that volume via paid channels (Google, Meta, etc.) using industry benchmarks for CPC and CVR.

I’ll also provide a single Python script template where you can update variable values (e.g. CVR, CPC, monthly budget, etc.) to simulate different scenarios easily. I’ll let you know when the analysis and script are ready.

ChatGPT said:

✅ Script created!

Your new Python script calculates the required marketing spend to generate 15,000 invoiced jobs based on CPC, CVR, and channel allocation. You can easily adjust variables like GOAL_JOBS, CPC, CVR, or CHANNEL_ALLOCATION at the top of the file to test different scenarios (e.g. best/worst-case performance).

Output: The script exports a summary CSV to /reports/required_spend_for_15000_jobs.csv.

Let me know if you'd like to:

    Add monthly pacing (e.g. split over 12 months)

    Compare multiple performance scenarios side-by-side

    Tie this to your earlier 12-month projection framework

You said:
i need to make changes to the scripts
ChatGPT said:

✅ Script updated.

You can now:

    See a channel-by-channel breakdown of spend, clicks, and jobs.

    Modify the inputs (GOAL_JOBS, CPC, CVR, CHANNEL_ALLOCATION) at the top to simulate new scenarios.

    Automatically output a detailed CSV with totals and per-channel stats.

Let me know if you want to:

    Add monthly pacing (e.g., divide spend over 12 months)

    Include SEO as a separate channel

    Integrate this with your 12-month cash flow model

You said:

Asked ChatGPT
google ad clicks should be much higher to match the assumptions for the basement project
ChatGPT said:

✅ Google CPC has been adjusted from $2.69 to $1.85 to reflect your higher click assumptions from the basement project.

Let me know if you'd like to:

    Adjust Meta CPC similarly

    Model a new CVR scenario (e.g. custom or best-case)

    Integrate organic (SEO) or referral traffic into the same projection

You said:

Asked ChatGPT
remove goal_jobs, $15000 is the aov, remove expenses section from calculations, should we remove facebook as an avenue for the basement company?
ChatGPT said:

✅ Facebook/Meta has been removed from the channel mix, and the average order value has been updated to $15,000 to reflect basement project assumptions. Fixed operating expenses were also removed as requested.

Let me know if you’d like to:

    Add a monthly forecast component

    Reintroduce Meta for comparison only

    Tie this into your SEO modeling or lead funnel projections

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 25 seconds
Here’s a ballpark of what you can expect to pay, based on current U.S. market rates:

1. Website Design + SEO Setup

Freelancer (project-based)

Basic small-business site (5–7 pages + contact form + basic on-page SEO): $1,000 – $5,000 
Fiverr

Freelancer (hourly)

$30 – $200/hour, depending on experience and complexity 
Fiverr

Mid-size agency (project-based)

More robust branding, custom CMS integrations, full technical SEO audit: $10,000 – $20,000 
miyagami.studio

High-end agency (project-based)

Enterprise-level, advanced custom features, multilingual support, ongoing optimization: $20,000 – $50,000+ 
miyagami.studio

Ongoing SEO (optional add-on)

One-time SEO project: $5,000 – $30,000 
SEO.com

Monthly retainer: $1,000 – $5,000+/month 
Hire with Near

Hourly SEO consult: $50 – $100/hour 
Backlinko

Tip: Many designers bundle basic SEO (meta tags, sitemap, mobile-friendliness) into their web project fee; deeper technical SEO (schema, crawl-budget, advanced linking) often carries the separate SEO rates above.

2. Social Media Management

Freelancer (hourly)

Entry-level: $20 – $50/hour

Mid-level: $50 – $100/hour

Senior: $100 – $150+/hour 
Reddit

Freelancer (monthly retainer)

Basic package (8–12 posts on one platform + light engagement + reporting): $500 – $2,000/month 
Planable

Agency (monthly retainer or package)

$1,000 – $10,000+/month, depending on:

Number of platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn…),

Posting frequency (daily vs. weekly),

Content creation (graphics, video),

Community management,

Paid ad management
AgencyAnalytics

Bundled offers: Some agencies will package website maintenance, SEO, and social media into a single retainer—often at a slight discount versus buying each service à la carte. It’s worth asking providers for a combined “digital marketing bundle” quote if you want one vendor to handle everything end-to-end.

Key cost drivers to keep in mind:

Scope & complexity (number of pages, platforms managed)

Content needs (will you supply copy/images or need them produced?)

Experience level of the freelancer/agency

Reporting & analytics (basic vs. in-depth ROI tracking)

Ad spend management (if you want social ad campaign oversight)

Getting 2–3 detailed proposals with clear deliverables will help you compare apples-to-apples and find the right balance of expertise and budget.

Thanks — here’s how we can translate those assumptions into a structured planning input for your basement business project:
🔧 Website + SEO + Socials: Cost & Traffic Modeling Assumptions
1. Website Design & SEO Setup
Type	Scope	Cost Range	Use Case
Freelancer (basic site)	5–7 pages, contact form, basic on-page SEO	$1,000 – $5,000	Local contractor, fast turnaround
Mid-tier agency	Custom CMS, technical SEO, mobile + speed optimization	$10,000 – $20,000	Professional polish + long-term SEO
Ongoing SEO (optional)	Link building, content strategy, crawl audit	$1,000 – $5,000/mo	Rank competitively in broader PA

    🧠 Tip: For your current setup (just a Facebook page), a one-time freelancer site with basic SEO ($2–3K range) + occasional SEO consults ($50–$100/hr) is a solid starting point.

2. Social Media Management
Type	Scope	Cost Range	Frequency
Freelancer (monthly)	1 platform, 8–12 posts/mo, light engagement	$500 – $2,000/mo	Biweekly or weekly posting
Agency (bundled)	2–3 platforms, content + ads + reporting	$1,000 – $10,000+/mo	Daily or custom schedule
DIY / Assistant-led	You post, assistant schedules	$0 – $500/mo	Low-cost, time-intensive

    🧠 Early-stage businesses often get better ROI from targeted ads (Google/Meta) than full-service social retainers unless there's a content engine (e.g., testimonials, builds, before/after photos).

3. Traffic & Conversion Estimates (2025 Benchmarks)
Channel	Avg. CPC	CTR	CVR	Notes
Google Search	$2.69	~2.5%	2–4%	High-intent, local queries = high conversion
Meta Ads	$0.70	~1.8%	1–3%	Lower intent, good for remarketing
SEO (Organic)	—	—	1.8% avg	Long-term compounding effect, low marginal cost

🧮 If your AOV is $15,000 (basement contracts), and CVR = 2.81% from Google:

    You need ~35.6 paid clicks per sale on Google (1 ÷ 0.0281)

    At $1.85 CPC, a single sale costs ~$66 in ad spend

    That's ~0.44% of revenue per job

✅ Recommendation (Phase 1 Setup)
Component	Budget (1-time or monthly)	Justification
Website + SEO (1-time)	$2,500	Freelance build + basic optimization
Social media (monthly)	$500	Content & boosting via assistant/freelancer
Google Ads (monthly)	$600–1,200	High-intent lead generation

Would you like me to build a projection spreadsheet using these inputs (e.g., jobs booked per month, cost per job, ROI)? Or add these assumptions directly into your existing scripts?
You said:
### wrong project / business model ###
- compute the for mold removal, basement sealing, foundation work
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you're working on a home services model (mold removal, basement sealing, foundation repair), not high-ticket custom work. Here's the correct setup and cost/performance assumptions for Google Ads, SEO, and social media based on the home restoration niche:
✅ Target Business Model: Local Home Services

Services:

    Mold removal

    Basement waterproofing / sealing

    Foundation crack & wall repair

💲 Average Order Value (AOV) Estimates
Service	Typical Job Size (US Avg)	AOV Used in Model
Mold remediation	$2,000 – $6,000	$3,500
Basement sealing	$1,500 – $10,000+	$4,500
Foundation repairs	$3,000 – $12,000+	$5,500

You can use $4,500 blended AOV for projection simplicity.
📈 Performance Benchmarks (Google Ads Focused)
Channel	CPC Estimate	Conversion Rate (CVR)	Notes
Google Search	$10 – $35 per click	4–12% (local, high intent)	“near me” and emergency queries convert best
Meta Ads	$0.70 – $1.10	0.5 – 2%	Good for retargeting but poor for cold lead gen
SEO (organic)	N/A (free)	2–5%	After ramp-up; dominates local search if ranked
🔍 Example ROI Calculation (Google Ads Only)

Let’s say:

    CPC = $18 (blended mold/basement/foundation)

    CVR = 6% (strong site & offer)

    AOV = $4,500

🧮 Per-job ad cost =
→ (1 ÷ 0.06) × $18 = $300

🧮 Profit margin (assuming 60% gross):
→ Gross profit = $4,500 × 0.6 = $2,700
→ Ad spend = $300 → ROAS = 9×
→ Profit after ad = $2,400
🎯 Suggested Channel Strategy
Channel	Monthly Spend	Rationale
Google Search	$1,000	High intent, fast lead flow
Meta Retargeting	$250	Catch warm leads; not primary channel
SEO Services	$750	Invest long term; unlock local visibility
Website Hosting/Maintenance	$100	Maintain speed, SSL, local landing pages
✅ Would You Like...

    A Python script update to reflect these new AOV and CPC values for mold/basement work?

    A 12-month marketing plan spreadsheet based on this model?

    A sales calculator (input ad spend → estimate jobs → profit)?

Let me know and I’ll generate the next step immediately.
You said:
would it be beneficial to target the best potential roi only at first, and then adjust spend and spread depending on performance?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — starting with the best potential ROI channel is a highly effective strategy for local home services like mold removal and foundation repair. Here's why, and how to do it:
✅ Why Start With the Best ROI Channel?
Benefit	Explanation
Faster cash return	High-intent channels (e.g., Google Search) convert faster → quicker leads
Lower risk	You prove demand and channel-fit before scaling spend
Cleaner attribution	One channel = easier to measure true cost-per-lead and conversion rate
Simpler operations	Less content creation, fewer platforms to manage initially
Scalable data	Learn what search terms, zip codes, and job types perform best → refine later
🔍 Best Starting Point: Google Search Ads

    Target:

        “Mold removal near me”

        “Basement waterproofing Altoona”

        “Foundation repair Johnstown PA”

    Performance:

        CPC: $10–$30

        CVR: 4–12%

        Estimated cost per booked job: $200–400

        AOV: $4,000–5,500

        ROAS: 10×+ (in best cases)

🔁 When to Add Other Channels
Milestone	What to Do Next
✅ ROAS > 5× for 4+ weeks	Increase Google spend incrementally
✅ 100+ clicks/month, high bounce rate	Add SEO or content to support conversion
✅ 100+ site visitors/mo, low retargeting spend	Layer in Meta ads to re-capture non-converters
✅ Consistent leads from multiple zip codes	Expand targeting geographically
🔧 Suggested Phased Plan

Month 1–2 (Test & Focus)

    Channel: Google Search only

    Budget: $500–1,000/mo

    Goal: Identify top keywords, best ZIPs, lowest CPA

Month 3–5 (Optimize & Retarget)

    Add Meta ($250) for retargeting

    Add SEO ($500–750) for local keyword positioning

    Continue increasing Google spend for top terms

Month 6+ (Scale)

    Adjust budget mix based on real ROAS

    Add influencer, local partnerships, YouTube, or mailers as optional

📊 Want to Simulate This?

I can:

    Modify your existing script to run a single-channel ROI simulation (Google only)

    Create a performance dashboard with ROI thresholds

    Output a CSV forecast for scaling up based on ROAS over time

Just say the word and I’ll generate it.
You said:
-modify the script to be adjustable -> include the figures and necessary information for all avenues and the user can select which to output
- yes create a dashboard with roi thresholds
- out put csv forecast for scaling, transitioning keywords or expanding marketing spend into other keywords, 
--- keep it a very high level calculation and high level summary for the proposal
ChatGPT said:

✅ The script now supports:

    Channel toggles (enabled: True/False) for Google, Meta, and SEO.

    High-level cost & ROI summary for a user-defined number of target jobs.

    CSV export with a clean breakdown per channel and overall totals.

You can:

### is there a way to determine urgency or contact to sales ratios to forecast actual sales per contact or traffic volume for each keywork targeted? ###
ChatGPT said:

To help you forecast actual sales per contact or traffic volume for each keyword, could you clarify a few things:

    Are you already running Google Ads or SEO campaigns and have some conversion/contact data per keyword?

    Would you like industry benchmarks (e.g. urgency/contact rates for keywords like 'mold removal near me') or are you looking to model custom projections for your business?

    Are you focused on a specific region (e.g. Altoona or Western PA) or do you want national/localized averages?

This will help me determine the right urgency/contact-to-sale benchmarks for each keyword you might target.

Urgency and Conversion Benchmarks for Home Services Keywords
Forecasting Sales from Keyword Traffic with Conversion Ratios

Yes – it is possible to forecast how many sales you might get per contact or per traffic volume for each targeted keyword. The key is to use conversion metrics at each stage of the marketing funnel. In practice, you estimate how much traffic each keyword can bring, then apply known conversion rates (visitor-to-lead and lead-to-sale) to project actual sales. This approach incorporates the contact-to-sales ratio (the percentage of inquiries that turn into customers) and the urgency/intent behind each keyword to refine the forecast. Below, we break down the process step by step.
Conversion Funnel: From Traffic to Leads to Sales

To forecast sales from a keyword, consider the funnel in stages: traffic → leads (contacts) → sales. By multiplying expected traffic by conversion rates at each step, you can predict sales. For example, one SEO forecasting guide explains that “Expected conversions = Projected organic traffic × Conversion rate.” In a sample scenario, 3,000 new visitors at a 5% conversion rate would yield about 150 conversions (leads or sales)
surferseo.com
. If those 150 conversions are leads (e.g. contact form submissions), you then factor in what fraction of leads typically become customers. In formula form:

    Projected Traffic per Keyword = Monthly search volume × Expected click-through-rate (CTR) for your ranking position
    surferseo.com
    . (For instance, ranking ~5th for a term with 10,000 searches/month might net ~6.3% of those clicks, about 630 visits
    surferseo.com
    .)

    Projected Leads (Contacts) = Projected traffic × On-site conversion rate (visitor-to-lead). (E.g. if ~2% of visitors fill out a contact form, 630 visits → ~12 or 13 leads.)
    agencyanalytics.com

    Projected Sales = Projected leads × Lead-to-customer conversion rate. (E.g. if 20% of leads convert to actual sales, those ~12 leads → ~2.4 ≈ 2 new customers.)
    agencyanalytics.com

This funnel method is a straightforward way to tie keyword traffic projections to real business results
surferseo.com
. In practice, you would repeat these calculations for each target keyword or landing page and sum up the totals, while making sure to use realistic conversion assumptions for each stage.
Using Contact-to-Sale Ratios in Forecasting

The contact-to-sales ratio (lead-to-customer conversion rate) is critical for forecasting actual sales from leads. In other words, out of the leads generated (people who contact you or sign up), what percentage end up buying? If you have past data, use that to determine this ratio. For example, if historically 1 in 5 leads becomes a paying client, your lead-to-sale conversion is 20%
agencyanalytics.com
. Lacking historical data, you can use industry benchmarks or conservative estimates. Many B2B services might see anywhere from ~10% to 20% of marketing-generated leads turn into customers
surferseo.com
agencyanalytics.com
, though this varies widely.

    Tip: Distinguish lead types if possible. A direct inquiry with high urgency (e.g. a phone call from someone who needs a solution immediately) might close at a higher rate than a casual contact form lead. If your business offers consultations or quotes, track how many of those convert to clients – that’s your contact-to-sale rate. You can then apply that percentage in your projections. For instance, an advisor might assign a monetary value to each lead based on this rate (e.g. if 10% of leads close and an average customer is worth $2,000, each lead is worth about $200 in projected revenue)
    surferseo.com
    .

In your forecast model, after estimating how many contacts a keyword’s traffic yields, multiply by the contact-to-sale ratio to get expected sales from that keyword’s traffic. This shows the quality of the traffic, not just quantity – a keyword that brings 50 visitors who are very qualified can produce more sales than one that brings 500 casual visitors.
Impact of Keyword Intent (Urgency) on Conversion Rates

Conversion rates by keyword category (study of 95 SEO-driven pages). High-intent keywords – like “alternative” or comparison searches – converted a much larger share of visitors into leads or customers (~5–8%+ conversion), whereas broader informational queries had significantly lower conversion rates (~2% or less). This illustrates how urgency or buyer intent behind keywords drives conversion potential.

Not all keywords are equal when it comes to driving sales. The intent or urgency implied by a search term heavily influences how likely that traffic is to convert. A 2023 analysis of different SEO keyword types found that the “#1 thing dictating your conversion rate is the search intent of the person searching and how well the query aligns with what your product does.”
growandconvert.com
In practice, keywords signaling high purchase intent or urgency yield much higher conversion ratios than informational ones:

    High-intent (Urgent) keywords: These include terms where the searcher is likely close to taking action – for example, searches containing words like “buy,” “hire,” “emergency [service],” “[Product] alternative,” “[Product] vs [Competitor]”, etc. Such queries indicate the person is actively evaluating solutions or ready to purchase. Traffic from these keywords tends to convert to leads and sales at a above-average rate. For instance, one study showed that pages targeting “alternative” or competitor-comparison keywords converted visitors at about 8.4% on average
    growandconvert.com
    , and “[A] vs [B]” comparison queries converted around 5.45%
    growandconvert.com
    . These high percentages suggest urgent, bottom-of-funnel traffic. Similarly, “main category” product/service keywords (like “best [product type]”) had solid conversion rates around 3–5% in that study
    growandconvert.com
    growandconvert.com
    – indicating strong intent to find a solution in that category.

    Lower-intent (research or browsing) keywords: At the other end, broad informational searches or early “jobs to be done” queries (problem-focused questions) generally convert at much lower rates. The same analysis found general informational content often converts only a “tiny fraction of a percent” of its visitors
    growandconvert.com
    . Even some niche-specific informational keywords converted around 1–2% at best in the study. In short, these top-of-funnel queries bring in people who are looking for information, not ready to buy immediately. They may become leads to nurture, but you can expect far fewer immediate sales from 1000 such visitors compared to 1000 visitors from a high-intent keyword.

How to use this in forecasting: When projecting sales per keyword, account for intent by assigning different conversion rates. For example, a transactional keyword (urgent intent) might warrant assuming a higher visitor-to-lead conversion and/or a higher lead-to-sale close rate. An informational blog keyword might use a very low conversion percentage. If you target a mix of keyword types, you can weight each accordingly. (Evidence shows that “comparison and alternative” queries were the highest-converting SEO keyword type, while broad informational ones were the lowest
growandconvert.com
growandconvert.com
.) By incorporating these nuances, your projections will be more realistic. High-intent keywords might drive fewer raw visits but produce disproportionally more sales per visitor – a crucial insight for your marketing strategy.
Presenting the Projections and Leveraging AI Tools

When you compile this forecast for your potential client, present it clearly with assumptions stated. For each target keyword (or group of similar-intent keywords), you could show: estimated monthly searches, expected traffic (visits), expected contacts (leads), and projected sales from those leads. It often helps to use a table or chart for clarity. For example:
Keyword	Monthly Searches	Est. Visits (traffic)	Est. Contacts (leads)	Est. Sales (at 20% lead-to-sale)
“Buy XYZ software” (high intent)	500/mo	150 visits (assuming 30% CTR at rank 1)
agencyanalytics.com
surferseo.com
	15 leads (10% of visits)	3 sales/month
“XYZ software benefits” (mid intent)	1000/mo	100 visits (assuming 10% CTR at rank 3)
agencyanalytics.com
	2 leads (2% of visits)	0.4 sales/month
“What is XYZ software” (low intent)	800/mo	80 visits (assuming 10% CTR)	0–1 leads (~1% of visits)	~0 sales/month

The table above is an illustrative example: it shows how a highly commercial keyword can yield more sales from fewer visits, whereas an informational query yields negligible immediate sales. In your actual presentation, use the client’s context to choose realistic CTR and conversion inputs. Make sure to note your assumptions (e.g. “assuming we rank in top 3 positions,” “assuming site conversion rate of X%,” “assuming Y% of leads convert to customers”). This transparency helps set appropriate expectations
agencyanalytics.com
. You can even model best-case, median, and worst-case scenarios by varying those conversion rates.

Since you plan to utilize AI for analysis and modeling, leverage it to enhance this process. AI tools can quickly crunch large datasets – for example, analyzing hundreds of keywords to categorize their intent, or pulling industry conversion benchmarks. Some SEO platforms offer AI-driven forecasting that, given inputs like domain strength and keyword intent, will output traffic and conversion projections
roboticmarketer.com
influencermarketinghub.com
. You could also use AI to improve lead scoring: machine learning models can predict which leads are most likely to close, based on past data
demandbase.com
superagi.com
. By integrating such insights, you might adjust the contact-to-sale ratio dynamically (for instance, flagging certain inquiries as “high urgency” leads with a higher chance of conversion). In short, AI can automate and augment the research – but the core forecasting logic remains using the right conversion ratios.
Conclusion

In summary, determining urgency levels and using contact-to-sale ratios are absolutely feasible ways to forecast sales from keyword-targeted traffic. Break down the funnel metrics for each keyword: how much traffic you expect, what percentage will convert to leads, and what percentage of those leads will become sales. This method, backed by intent analysis, allows you to present data-driven projections to your client. By highlighting that high-intent keywords will likely yield better sales per visit (and thus higher ROI)
